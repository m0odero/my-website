After years of dreaming, planning, and countless self-nudges, this project is live! I’m a mostly behind-the-scenes learner, thinker, and worker. But I’m continuously learning to stop staying in the shadows, as I cannot continue to ignore the undeniable power of visibility. This website is my step into the light—a blend of the technical, the reflective, and the personal, woven into the journey I’ve been on for years. From professional insights to daily musings and life’s side projects, this platform offers a window into my world.

The three main sections—Articles, Portfolio, and Life Outside Work—embody my pursuit for balance. I’m a data science and power systems professional, a hiker, gardener, wanna-be runner, African fiction fan, and a crochet artist. These different aspects are essential parts of me, and each deserves a corner on this platform.

As a curious learner, I find documenting my insights an effective way to map out new information and build on my knowledge. In the Articles section, you’ll find an account of my learning journey and thought process. After four years of being immersed in the dynamic intersection of power systems and data science, I’m excited to share my insights, experiences, and curious discoveries. This section captures my evolving journey through power systems, mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and more. It is more than just sharing knowledge; it is about highlighting surprising issues, exploring perspectives, and delving into the technical complexities of how the grid works and how data can be a powerful tool in revealing its characteristics. Here, I explore niche topics—from technical aspects of the grid to broader issues in the energy sector—driven by curiosity and a desire to understand. The articles are also an account of my exploration of how the world of power systems function in the context of  economics, policy, and governance.

My experience in the energy sector has connected me with diverse stakeholders—from academics and utilities to regulators and development organizations. Through these collaborations, I’ve seen firsthand how data is transforming the field, yet the untapped potential is immense. Every dataset holds another piece of the story, waiting to shape the future of energy. In the Portfolio section, I document my journey at the data-energy-mathematics crossroads. Here, you’ll find projects that bridge these fields, from mathematical models to analytics experiments. Each project reflects my curiosity about how data can deepen our understanding of power systems. This section is about making the most of data through analytics, visualization, machine learning, modeling, and statistics—brought to life by the power of programming.

Finally, Life Outside Work is where I share the activities that bring balance to my world. Hiking is one of my greatest passions: I’m a bucket-list hiker, finding joy in summiting each mountain and savoring that rush at the top. Nairobi’s marathons are also a favorite, though I’ve accepted that running isn’t exactly my strength—but that won’t keep me from showing up. Kitchen gardening, crochet, and African fiction all make up this section, each offering a unique source of inspiration and joy. These diverse interests not only provide a welcome respite from the demands of my professional life but also contribute to my personal growth. They challenge me physically, mentally, and creatively, helping me maintain a well-rounded perspective.

This platform is more than a collection of knowledge; it’s a window into my journey to unravel the complexities of my world. It's a testament to the power of curiosity, the joy of learning, and the beauty of sharing. Whether you're here for the technical insights, the project showcases, or a glimpse into my life beyond work, I hope you find something that resonates. Welcome to my digital home—a space where energy, data, and life's adventures converge.
