## Introduction
Electricity powers more than just lights, it drives economic growth, has a direct effect on the prices of goods and services, and weighs on every household and business budget. Any change in electricity prices immediately impacts people’s purchasing power, making power pricing a matter of public interest.
Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are a crucial tool in this regard, designed to lower electricity costs by encouraging competitive energy procurement. Through its main electricity utility company, Kenya Power, Kenya has signed at least 42 PPAs with private developers to address high electricity tariffs. Yet, electricity prices in Kenya continued to rise. On 29th March 2021, President Kenyatta appointed a Taskforce for the Review of Power Purchase Agreements (the Taskforce). The Taskforce was tasked to review existing PPAs,  investigate why electricity prices were rising despite these agreements, and possibly terminate or renegotiate unfavorable ones.  All ongoing PPA negotiations were also halted during the Taskforce’s tenure. A year later, in 2023, a proposal for legislative reforms followed, with Senator Edwin Sifuna sponsoring the Energy (Amendment) Bill, 2023 a senator proposing new measures meant to enhance the management of PPAs. These efforts reveal that PPAs are far more complex than they appear and do not automatically result in electricity price reductions.
This article explores the nature of PPAs, their implementation challenges in Kenya, and their impact on electricity prices. It examines, for example, why some of these agreements have paradoxically led to price increases and what possible measures can be used to address this issue.
What is a PPA?

Fig 1: Classification of power contracts. A PPA is a long term power contract.

A PPA is an agreement between a state-owned utility and a private sector player known as an independent power producer (IPP) stating the terms and conditions under which the IPP will generate power and sell it to the national utility for a long period, usually several years. The long-term nature of these agreements provides security for lenders, a guarantee for investment recovery, encouraging investment in power generation projects.
Historically, state-owned distribution utilities, e.g. Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC), have bought electricity from state-owned generation utilities such as KenGen. This has created a monopoly in the electricity sector where electricity is only produced by the state owned companies. The introduction of private sector competition serves dual purposes: reducing electricity costs through market competition and facilitating the transition to renewable energy sources. Private operators, with specialized expertise in renewable technologies, complement utilities' experience in traditional generation sources - hydro and thermal. The substantial capital requirements for power plant development are addressed through long-term PPAs, which provide the revenue certainty necessary to secure project financing from lenders.

## How does a utility get into a PPA with an IPP?
The initiation of Power Purchase Agreements typically follows a systematic process. This begins with needs assessment studies examining factors such as population growth, expansion of electricity access, and requirements for various reserve capacities (including spinning, fast-start, and black-start reserves). The need for renewable energy integration could also necessitate a PPA. For context, geothermal and hydro, which are renewable sources, account for over 65% of Kenya’s generation mix.  As suchGiven Kenya’s predominantly renewable generation mix (primarily geothermal and hydroelectric), the motivation for PPAs should center more on capacity expansion and other needs than renewable energy transition.
Once needs assessment studies have been conducted, the conventional procurement process involves competitive auctions where IPPs bid in response to utility requests for proposals. Price competitiveness is a primary selection criterion in the process. However, IPPS may sometimes approach the government with unsolicited proposals, resulting in a PPA. Such non-competitive arrangements often result in suboptimal pricing structures, ultimately transferring higher costs to end consumers. This practice contradicts the fundamental objective of PPA frameworks: achieving cost-efficient electricity generation through market competition.
Once an IPP has been selected, they enter into the negotiation phase to nail down the specifics of the agreement before signing. Figure 2 summarizes this entire process.

## Risk Allocation, Pricing, and Performance Guarantees
PPAs are complex contracts documents involving large amounts of money hence require extensive negotiation, often taking years to finalize. The core focus of these negotiations is on allocating risk among various stakeholders. The key components usually considered include contract duration, generation technology, quantity of electricity, and performance guarantees. Environmental and social impact considerations are also crucial.
Pricing and payment structure is also another key component in risk allocation. The payment structure in PPAs is multifaceted, including capacity charges, generation charges, curtailment charges, and deemed generation charges. The decision on these determines which entity bears what risks.

## The Kenyan Scene: PPA Implementation Challenges
To date, Kenya has signed more than 42 PPAs, many of which are not publicly available for scrutiny. The implementation of many of these has faced several challenges, leading to unexpected outcomes in some cases.
First, some IPPs bypassed the competitive procurement process of PPAs, denying the chance to select the best bidder based on price. This has led to high tariffs which the utility passes on to the final consumer.
The underutilization of thermal power plants, as indicated by the low utilization factor (Table 1), has driven up costs per kWh, undermining the initial goal of price reduction. Utilization factor at dispatch is the ratio of actual energy output from a generation source to its maximum capacity on a near-real-time basis. The low utilization factors from IPPs in Table 1 raise critical questions about optimal capacity planning and the appropriate balance between baseload and peak power sources. If high-cost power plants are underutilized, does this imply an inefficient use of resources, or is it desirable because their operation is reserved for peak times? Additionally, why aren't cheaper energy sources prioritized more effectively, and are capacity payments for unused plants adding unnecessary financial burdens? Furthermore, if only 11-14% of installed capacities are being utilized, would it have been more prudent to negotiate smaller Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to align better with demand patterns? These considerations highlight the need for a clear rationale in determining capacity sizes and selecting energy sources to minimize costs while ensuring reliability.

Allegations of ownership conflicts of interest between Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and utility staff have further complicated the energy sector’s challenges. Specifically, two thermal Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are under scrutiny for potential ownership conflicts, contributing to high costs despite the plants remaining largely idle. Additionally, the Lake Turkana Wind Power (LTWP) PPA has faced similar concerns, with reported conflicts of interest between the IPP and the contractor responsible for the transmission line. Delays in completing the transmission line—aggravated by the contractor's bankruptcy—have resulted in significant deemed generation charges, raising the question of who the financial responsibility falls on. This situation underscores the complexity of clarifying contractual obligations, ensuring that both project risks and costs are fairly distributed.

Table 1: Power generation details of some companies that KPLC has purchased power from. Apart from KenGen, the state owned generation company, the others have entered into a PPA with KPLC. Most of these are charging way higher prices per kWh than the state-owned KenGen, which is the opposite of the expectation for a PPA.

## Concluding Thoughts
Power Purchase Agreements remain a vital tool for energy sector development in Kenya, offering a structured approach to private sector participation in power generation. However, their implementation has revealed significant challenges that need to be addressed to achieve the intended goals of lower electricity prices and improved energy access. For example…

Moving forward, the focus should be on continuous improvement in how PPAs are structured and implemented. This includes ensuring transparency, maintaining competitive processes, and aligning agreements with broader energy sector goals. The report of the presidential taskforce on review of PPAs 20222 outlines some of these recommendations. By learning from past experiences and implementing necessary reforms, Kenya can work towards a more efficient and equitable energy sector that truly serves the needs of its citizens.
